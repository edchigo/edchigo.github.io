What on Earth is DisneySea?
Well, as a massive Disney fan myself, I could argue that any Disney theme is worth the visit. However, what strikes out about DisneySea is that it is the only one of its kind in the world, and importantly, it is in Tokyo! The first place on our Itinerary! How could I not?

Disneysea has a theme of, you guessed it, the sea! It also features characters that haven’t yet been featured in any other park such as Rapunzel, as well as its own character Duffy, a bear character, just as popular as Mickey Mouse in Asia.
The latest expansion of the park, Fantasy Springs, brings to life a Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, Frozen, and Tangled rides which I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t a major draw for me!
I was at first concerned that Fantasy Springs would be a timed area and/or a priority line for all the rides, however it was recently announced that as of the 1st April 2025 that there will only be standby lines – the typical queue experience. I for one think this is a great decision because who doesn’t want to experience the wonder of the lantern festival from Tangled?

The next step was persuading Eddie, who, while I’m certain enjoyed our trip to Disneyland Paris in 2023 was less keen when we had all of Japan to choose between! The compromise for us was one Disney park and Japan has two main theme parks, both in Tokyo on the same site, Disneyland Tokyo and DisneySea. In an ideal world, we would go to both and choose our favourite, however, this is not a Disney trip and we want to pack as much of Japan into our trip as physically possible. Plus I wanted to also go to Universal Studios Japan and there’s only so much money and theme parks Eddie and I can take! From all my research Disneyland Tokyo appears to be similar to Disneyland Paris which was a trip we went on in 2023. Eddie and I decided that it would be a more unique experience to go to DisneySea, so Disneysea it was!

With the appearance of Venice, the American Waterfront and Ariel’s playground, there is a world of wonder to await us and we cannot wait!
:D

Thanks for reading!
