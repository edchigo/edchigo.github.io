"Yoi Ryōko O", A warm message of farewell from my family, translating roughly to mean "Have a good trip!", and just like that we're off!
After what feels like an eternity of waiting, i'm now 8 hours into a 14 hour flight, hoping my hour of free wifi lasts long enough to type this out!

As flights go, besides the slightly numb feeling after sitting for so long, it's not been so bad! Complimentary moist towels, pillows and blankets, and more food and free sake than you can imagine! Japan Airlines is pulling out all the stops to give us a comfortable journey!
We even managed to catch a few hours sleep. Considering the entire previous night we battled to stay awake, to better counter the jetlag, a few hous sleep was precious! Not to mention we'll be arriving at 7am local time, ready to start a whole new day!

Hope this short update has reassured you all that we're safe and well in our first leg of the journey, and hey, if something goes wrong in the remaining 5 hours of flight, let it be known we went down in comfort and style!

See you in Japan!
